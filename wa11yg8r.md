## Wallygator Validator

This is a vanity/busking page for my [Safecoin](https://safecoin.org) validator whose name is Wallygator.  

Please [stake Stake STAKE!!!](https://stake.safecoin.org/#/) Wallygator Validator whose pubkey is `BHSX2WERLf4c7XAQcJSzeYyEva6vf5crVYjh2D7kSn14`.

## Nuggets of Content
As is customary when passing the hat you need to have performed something to entertain or elucidate.  To that end I do have some basic helpful documents that are worth putting up here.

* [My notes on validator setup](Accounts.md) meant to accompany the [basic validator setup document](https://safecoin.org/validator-set-up-instructions/).
* [Notes on creating a vanity pubkey](Vanity.md) using `safecoin-keygen`.
* [ELI5: Safecoin Improved Consensus](Consensus.md).
* [Serum Clone](Serum.md).

## About Me
My name is Charles, I am retired and old enough to remember crappy Hanna-Barbera cartoons from the 1960s. I came to the Safecoin project after hearing about Solana but not having $100,000 (realistically IHMO) to devote to putting a validator into their cluster. 

## Things I like about the Safecoin project

- It is built on the excellent foundation of Solana.

- I have had the opportunity to learn rust and make source code contributions.

- The online community is positive, enthusiastic, extremely helpful and grounded in reality
I am a retired software dev so the use of rust for development as well as Solana's (Safecoin's) promising, interesting architecture drew me in.  

- And, finally using Safecoin I launch my own validator in the Safecoin mainet cluster and this page is a billboard for that validator.

## Why Wallygator?
Possible answers:
* [Wallygator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Gator) is my favorite [Hanna-Barbera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna-Barbera) cartoon character after [Yogi Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Bear) and [Magilla Gorilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magilla_Gorilla).
* I am trolling people for whom their primary language has 'W' sounding a lot like the american 'V' (or is the other way around?)
* (No, I would never do that.)

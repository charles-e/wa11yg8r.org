## Welcome to Wallygator

This is a vanity page for my [Safecoin](https://safecoin.org) validator whose name is Wallygator.  

This website is the online equivalent of passing the hat.   Please [stake my validator](https://stake.safecoin.org/#/) whose pubkey is `BHSX2WERLf4c7XAQcJSzeYyEva6vf5crVYjh2D7kSn14`.

## About Me
My name is Charles, I came to this project after hearing about Solana but not having $100,000 (realistically IHMO) to devote to putting a validator into their cluster.  I am a retired software dev and the use of rust for development as well as Solana's promising, interesting architecture drew me in.  
It has been an opportunity to learn about crypto.  And, finally I was able to create my own validator in the Safecoin mainet cluster and this page is a billboard for that validator.

As is customary when passing the hat you need to have performed something to entertain or elucidate.  To that end I do have some basic helpful documents that are worth putting up here.

* [My notes on validator setup](Accounts.md) meant to accompany the [basic validator setup document](https://safecoin.org/validator-set-up-instructions/).
* [Notes on creating a vanity pubkey](Vanity.md) using `safecoin-keygen`.
